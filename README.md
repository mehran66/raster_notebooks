## About
This repository was created for a talk I'll be giving to a group of students participating the the [NASA SARP internship](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/earthscience/programs/airbornescience/studentairborneresearchprogram).  **The code is not finished and should still be considered a work in progress.**

The contents of this repository has documentation jupyter notebooks for working with raster data.  It uses AVIRIS data as inputs to many of the scripts.

Any AVIRIS file should work with these notebooks.

_TODO document which files I used and where to download_
